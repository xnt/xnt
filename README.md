 ### Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Vicente Plata. Thank you for stopping by.

I enjoy creating tools, systems and processes to improve people's lives. Customers, developers, stakeholders, etc. As well as measuring 
said impact. I don't like pigeonholing myself with regards to languages, technologies, and the like. In the past, I've worked 
extensively with Java (rather wouldn't again), C#, PowerShell, Ruby (Rails), SQL (Postgres) JavaScript (React, React Native) and others. 
But what really moves me is helping teams, people, and organizations grow and improve with a data-driven, transparency-focused approach.

Most of my work time is dedicated to supporting [hims 🌵](https://forhims.com) and [hers 💁‍♀](https://forhers.com) as an engineering 
lead, primarily with the frontend of our medical records system. Or, helping [Terminal 🌎](https://terminal.io) scale and strengthen in 
the Mexican and Canadian engineering communities. Time-permitting, I also collaborate on independent projects at a high-level, or help 
with consulting services on remote engineering and culture (which I did since way before it was ~COVID~ cool :smile:) .

I'm convinced that software and technology's impact continues to be a net possitive in the world. But we can always do more, and do better. 
I'd be more than happy to chat about ways in which you think we could make the world a better place with them. Reach out via:
