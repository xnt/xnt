 ### Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Vicente Plata. Thank you for stopping by.

#### Work

I enjoy creating tools, systems and processes to improve people's lives. Customers, developers, stakeholders, etc. As well as measuring 
said impact. I don't like pigeonholing myself with regards to languages, technologies, and the like. In the past, I've worked 
extensively with:

  - Java (for 10-ish years, and rather wouldn't again)
  - C#
  - PowerShell
  - Ruby (Rails)
  - SQL (Postgres) 
  - JavaScript (React, React Native) 
  - and others
  
But what really moves me is helping teams, people, and organizations grow and improve with a data-and-transparency-driven approach.

#### What I do

Most of my work time is dedicated to:

  - having fun at [hims 🌵](https://forhims.com) and [hers 💁‍♀](https://forhers.com) as an engineering lead, primarily with the frontend 
  of our medical records system
  - helping [Terminal 🌎](https://terminal.io) scale and strengthen their footprint in the Mexican and Canadian engineering communities
  - supporting spanish-speaking engineers as an advisor at [Devz](https://devz.mx), by organizing meetups, podcasts, and workshops to help 
  our members improve their skills and have a more powerful impact on the industry.
  - time-permitting, I also collaborate on independent projects at a high-level, or help with consulting services on remote engineering 
  and culture (which I did since way before it was ~COVID~ cool :smile:) .

#### Contact

I'm convinced that software and technology's impact continues to be a net possitive in the world. But we can always do more, and do better. 
I'd be more than happy to chat about ways in which you think we could make the world a better place with them: either just to chat, as an 
advisor, or in a pro-bono kind of thing (recruiters: I'm not interested in another full-time-ish opportunity, unless it's an **extremely** 
good deal for both of us and in all dimensions).
